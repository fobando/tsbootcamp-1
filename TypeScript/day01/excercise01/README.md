The first lab, is just to make sure your environment 

- TypeScript 
- NodeJS
- NPM 

```
tsc
npm start
```

***tsc*** command will transpile the typescript files .ts into java script files .js and placed them into the ***dist*** directory.

***npm start*** command will run the index.js inside the dist diretory. This will read the launch.json file and run the index.js with node js.
