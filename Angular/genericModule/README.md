# Generic Module

This is a scaffold project that you are required to complete the following steps:


## Excercise 

## STEP 1:

Implement the http service to read the mockup/successLogin.json and mockup/unsuccessfullLogin.json respectively to popup the appropriate error using a Material Design Snack Bar component:

[Snack Bar documentation] (https://material.angular.io/components/snack-bar/overview)

**Note:** keep in mind that for every new component from Angular Material, you must include it according to the API inside the src/app/app.material.ts material design module.

You are mocking up the data from this json files because we don't have the backend API available at this moment. 

**Tip:** For the http variable in the login.service.ts is transparent to call a local file or an http end point.


## STEP 2:

You are required to ask the user for a confirmation, whenever the Log Out button is pressed,  using a Material Design component of your choice. 

**Important:** keep in mind that you will need to run `npm install` and `ng serve --open` in order to run the application.
