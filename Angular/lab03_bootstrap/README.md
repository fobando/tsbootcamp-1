# Solution for Lab03
# THIS CONTAINS THE SAME CODE as in LAB03 , however
##it uses bootstrap UI framework

You were required to build an Angular Client Applications that would simulate inside a service class the call to the ATM  WebService with mockup data.

The methods exposed in ATM Service Class shoud be :
## getCurrentBalance() - withDraw() - deposit() and getLastOperations()

In order to execute it, you should have the ATM Web Service from Lab02 already running on port 3000. then either clone bootcamp repo or git pull to update if you already cloned it, then run `ng serve --open` to run the application and open your browser.
