You were required go implement the following:

- Guard the routes based upon authentication status [account/pin] by implementing canActivate
  in its own service
- Reset by zero the amount for a Deposit/Withdrawl 
- Make child routes for the main ATM Operation
- Create a Router Module that holds the router configuration

In order to execute it, you should have the ATM Web Service from  **AtmWebServiceMongo** from the TypeScript folder already running on port 3000. then either clone bootcamp repo or git pull to update if you already cloned it, then run `ng serve --open` to run the application and open your browser.

NOTE: Keep note that this Angular Cient Application still needs the unsecured ATM WEB SERVICE MONGO edition from the TypeScript project.
